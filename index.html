			<p id="p1"> I am a software Engineering student at Western University. I am currently just starting my second year of studies in 2022. 
			I am very passionate about becoming an engineer and developing my skills in any way possible. One of my goals in life is to become an employee
			at google. Outside of Engineering I enjoy playing several sports as well as volunteering in my community. </p> <br> <br> <br> 
			
			<h3 id="workexperience"> Work Experience </h3> <br> 
			
			<p id= "p2"> During my summers, I have worked at many different places. This includes working at the YMCA as a camp counciller. Currently
			I am an employee at Scotiabank working as a bank teller. I look forward to applying for many software related internships and coops that will
			help me advance my career and further develop my software skills.
